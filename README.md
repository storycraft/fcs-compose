# FCS Compose: Functional Component System
Experiment project for composing complex app update logic using react-like hook and persistent value store system.

The experiment's goal is allowing user to maintain GUI states without suffering from rust's ownership and lifetime issue (and without ugly RefCells).

## Example
`examples/counter.rs`: simple counter app example.
